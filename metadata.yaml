description: The lessons herein taught are such as cannot be learned too early, nor
  dwelt on too long or too often, by those who are engaged in the active and all-absorbing
  duties of life. In the struggle for natural riches?the wealth that meets the eye
  and charms the imagination?how many forget that true riches can only be laid up
  in the heart; and that, without these true riches, which have no wings, gold, the
  god of this world, cannot bestow a single blessing! To give this truth a varied
  charm for young and old, the author has made of it a new presentation, and, in so
  doing, sought to invest it with all.
